# Hi, I’m Alessandro 👋

I’m studying Data Science and Machine Learning.
I like building end-to-end projects (data collection → SQL database → analysis/model → results).

## What I’m working on

### 1) AI for Student Performance Analysis
A project to analyze students’ mistakes and performance over time and identify weak/strong topics.
Goal: generate a clear diagnostic report and suggest what to study next.

**Focus:** data analysis, classification, recommendations  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn

---

### 2) Material Fracture Prediction (Chemical Engineering)
ML project related to materials engineering: using experimental data to predict fracture/failure behavior.
Goal: support material selection and research experiments with data-driven modeling.

**Focus:** regression/classification, feature engineering, evaluation  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter

---

### 3) Churn Reduction (Customer Retention)
End-to-end churn analysis to identify customers at risk and the drivers behind churn.
Goal: build a churn prediction model and provide actionable insights to improve retention.

**Focus:** SQL analytics, segmentation, classification, explainability  
**Tools:** SQL (SQLite), Python, scikit-learn

---

### 4) Smart Trader (Bitcoin)
A trading research project on Bitcoin market data: building a complete pipeline for feature engineering,
ML experiments and strategy evaluation with backtesting.

**Focus:** time series, ML, backtesting metrics  
**Tools:** Python, PyTorch/scikit-learn, Jupyter
